# Coupled-ABM-Hydrol-Formoso

This is an ongoing work that aims to develop a socio-hydrological framework by coupling Agent-based (GAMA) and Hydrological Modeling (WEAP).
This work has been carried out at the University of Brasília by Master's student Déborah Sousa, with support from other professors and students. Our goal is to understand cooperation among farmers and allocation mechanisms related to irrigation in the Urubu river basin, a sub-basin of the Brazilian Formoso river basin. 

This is part of the "Rede de Pesquisa para Gestão de Alto Nível dos Recursos Hídricos na Bacia do Rio Formoso -TO" project, funded by CAPES-ANA, Programa de Apoio ao Ensino e à Pesquisa Científica  e  Tecnológica  em  Regulação  e  Gestão  de  Recursos  Hídricos –Pró-Recursos Hídricos, call nº. 16/2017.

We use supply and demand data from the GAN System database (https://gan.iacuft.org.br/), which is a pioneer management platform in Brazil developed as a response to the observed water scarcity in July 2016 in the Formoso and Urubu rivers in the state of Tocantins, Brazil.

GAMA platform is used with GAML language.
Analysis were carried out using Python.

To run the model:

Download GAMA 1.8.2: https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/releases/tag/1.8.2-RC1
Import (https://gama-platform.github.io/wiki/ImportingModels) the model 'UrubuRiverModel.gaml' and the includes.
