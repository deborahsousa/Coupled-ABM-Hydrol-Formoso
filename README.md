# Coupled-ABM-Hydrol-Formoso

This is an ongoing project that aims to develop a socio-hydrological framework by coupling Agent-based (GAMA) and Hydrological Modeling (WEAP).
The project is currently being developed to understand cooperation among farmers and allocation mechanisms related to irrigation in the Urubu river basin, a sub-basin of the Brazilian Formoso river basin.
We use supply and demand data from the GAN System database (https://gan.iacuft.org.br/), which is a pioneer management platform in Brazil developed as a response to the observed water scarcity in July 2016 in the Formoso and Urubu rivers in the state of Tocantins, Brazil.

GAMA platform is used with GAML language.
Analysis were carried out using Python.

To run the model:

Download GAMA 1.8.2: https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/releases/tag/1.8.2-RC1
Import (https://gama-platform.github.io/wiki/ImportingModels) the model 'UrubuRiverModel.gaml' and the includes.
